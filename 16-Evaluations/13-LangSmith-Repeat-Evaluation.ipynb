    "\n",
    "> Repetitive evaluation is a method of more accurately measuring a model's performance by conducting multiple evaluations on the same dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add repetition to the experiment. This notebook demonstrates how to use `LangSmith` for repeatable evaluations of language models. It covers setting up evaluation workflows, running evaluations on different datasets, and analyzing results to ensure consistency. The focus is on leveraging `LangSmith`'s tools for reproducible and scalable model assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the evaluation to be repeated multiple times, which is useful in the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For larger evaluation sets\n",
    "- For chains that can generate variable responses\n",
    "- For evaluations that can produce variable scores (e.g., `llm-as-judge`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn how to run an evaluation from [this site](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/evaluate_llm_application#evaluate-on-a-dataset-with-repetitions).\n",
